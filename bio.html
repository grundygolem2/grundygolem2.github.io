<h1>John Casey's Biography</h1>
<div id="bio">
<h3>Before University</h3>
<p>I was born in a little city called Grasse in the south of France to a pair of ex-pats. We lived there for a few years before moving back to the states. We moved around a lot when I was young, before settling in Milwaukee, Wi, where I went to middle and high school. I took my first Computer Science courses in high school, learning the very basics of theory and programming. Eventually my years as a kid were done, and I decided to go to Tufts for university.</p>
<h3>Freshman and Sophomore Years</h3>
<p>My first two years at school were much like everyone else's. I made friends, learned a lot, and eventually discovered that I really enjoyed computer science, even working my way through the challenge that was Comp 40. At the end of my sophomore year, I decided that I was far enough along in my work that I could take some time to study abroad, and chose the Tufts program in Germany.</p>
<h3>Junior Year Abroad</h3>
<p>Germany was a challenge. Not only were all of my classes in German, but most of my social life was as well. I had a bit of trouble adapting, but I made it through through and made a great group of friends I hope to visit again one day.</p>
<h3>Current Activities</h3>
<p>I am entering my last year at Tufts, with no small amount of trepidation and excitement. I am teaching a class, researching a history paper, and finalizing my computer science work this semester. I hope I finish with a bang.</p>
